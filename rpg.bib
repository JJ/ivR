abstract = {Gaming has been identified as a way to increase student engagement in the classroom. This qualitative study explored 78 undergraduate students' experiences with a role-playing game infused into two computer science courses. Open-ended student surveys served as the primary data source to explore, "In what ways, if any, does role-playing quest based curriculum support student learning and engagement?" Key curricular innovations are described along with assignments and assessments that were integrated. Three broad themes emerged and identified personalized learning, deepened content understandings, and enhanced collaboration skills as three areas that supported student learning and engagement. Many students felt that the infusion of role-playing aspects into the courses supported their learning and engagement, but some students did not.},
