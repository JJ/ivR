abstract = {Software systems are present in people's lives and they are increasing to the same extent as their complexity and their criticality. Therefore, we must ensure that these systems maintain high quality in order to behave as expected. To develop high quality software, it is essential to have qualified people who are knowledgeable about Validation and Verification (V&V) techniques, especially software testing. This paper reports on the teaching process in two undergraduate courses in two different contexts: Computer Science students, who can dedicate more time during the day to studying, and Information Systems students, who can only study during the evenings. To engage and motivate the students in the context of software testing learning, we studied ways to bring real industry problems to the classroom in order to adopt the Problem-based Learning (PBL) approach. We chose two real open source projects which, considering the feedback from students and professors, was a good decision. However, the approach requires students to take extra classes rather than teacher-centered approaches. Extra classes may hinder the approach when the class consists of students who work during the day, thus developing a balance between student-centered and teacher-centered can be a good solution in such contexts.},

    abstract = { Project-based learning (PBL) is an active student-centred form of instruction which is characterised by students’ autonomy, constructive investigations, goal-setting, collaboration, communication and reflection within real-world practices. It has been explored in various contexts and in different phases of schooling, from primary to higher education. The majority of the reviewed studies were based on a quasi-experimental pretest–posttest design with some baseline equivalence established but no random allocation of participants to control and experimental groups, and as a result, a causal link between PBL instruction and positive student outcomes cannot be established with certainty. Modern digital technology, group processes of high quality, teachers’ ability to effectively scaffold students’ learning and provide guidance and support, the balance between didactic instruction with in-depth inquiry methods and well-aligned assessment have been identified in the literature as facilitating factors in the implementation of PBL. The article concludes with six key recommendations considered to be essential for the successful adoption of a PBL approach in the mainstream school setting. }

abstract = {We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students’ perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students’ motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students’ response to being actively engaged in the classroom.}}
